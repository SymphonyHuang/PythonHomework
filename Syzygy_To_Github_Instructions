Documentation of pushing and cloning using syzygy and github 

To share from syzygy to the public on github (PUSH)

1. Go to terminal on syzygy (control panel -> new -> terminal)
2. Use ls to see which folder you're in (what it contains)
3. Use cd to go into a subfolder and cd .. to go back up a folder
4. Initialize a repository in that folder by command git init
5. Add files of that folder to the repository by command git add . (mind the space and period)
6. Good practice to use command git status to check what was added
7. Use command git commit -m 'book keeping message' as a type of pre-pushing action
8. Set up the connnection with your github repository by command git remote add origin 'your_github_folder_url'
Example: https://username/folder
9. Use command git push -u origin master
10. Should be in your github folder
11. Note that you just have to initialize a repository in the one folder once

2. git add . 
3. git status
